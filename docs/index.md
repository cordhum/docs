# CORDH Data Harmonisation Group  


The website outlines modelling choices in relation to diverse entities described in the Consortium's data. The modelling is provided, whenever possible, using CIDOC-CRM. However, in certain cases other ontologies are used. 
For each of the described entities diverse encoding choices were outlined, and decision about them were made. Scope of this document is not to provide a track of this process, but just to present its results. The documentation of the possible modelling and encoding of an entity in RDF can be found in the [Annex A](#).

For each entity, as an example of its use, an RDF encoding of a real-world statements is provided. The syntax of the encoding is Turtle, and all the prefix used can be found on [http://prefix.cc/](http://prefix.cc/) .
