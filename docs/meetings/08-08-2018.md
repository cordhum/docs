# CORDH Meeting 08/08 2018

### Participants

- Nicola
- Florian
- Lukas
- Leo Z.

## Meta discussion

The Github documentation website has been updated and the docs have been reviewed. New functionalities includes:
- Search
- TOC for modelling doc
New graphic interface

+ <mark>[ACTION]</mark> Transfer the documentation from Nicola's repository to CORDH and host it under http://docs.cordh.net - The solution stand until we have a functional documentation website.
	+ [] @Nicola is going to transfer the repository and the website
	+ [] @Lukas is going to share the DNS records

The cordh.net graphical mock-up (available [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/BZMK21C5FGT#/screens/307021716)) developed thanks to the graphic designer of I Tatti is ready. To do:
- Change English logo for UZH and ETH. The english version of the logo has been provided by Leo Zorc and available at this address: [https://shared.ethz.ch/s/Zqb2Qt5CJgpdaXb](https://shared.ethz.ch/s/Zqb2Qt5CJgpdaXb)
- Implementing the website in Jekyll 
No volunteers regarding the implementation appears on the horizon. The issue will be discussed in a future meeting with the whole consortium. 

Max Planck developed a tool for the reverse mapping of x3ml files. Starting from an x3ml mapping it reads the mapped value it creates the field definition in SPARQL for Researchspace. The tool has been shared on github and available [here](https://github.com/cordhum/3m-mappings-to-field-definitions/blob/master/MappingToFields.ipynb)


## Modelling 

### Dimension
Nicola suggest to use OM an ontology for the mapping of quantities kind (length/width etc.) and unit of measure (cm/kg). On overview of the ontology can be seen [here](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj177_7.pdf). While the model is on [github](https://github.com/HajoRijgersberg/OM) and more information for each entity is available on their website [http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org). A comparison of ontology of unit of measure has been the subject of the article ["Comparison and Evaluation of Ontologies for
Units of Measurement"](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj1708.pdf).
[AGREEMENT] Agreed as way to go.
Changed has been made on the modelling website. 

### Name and Surname

Max-Planck and I Tatti are not differentiating between name and surname in their records, but ETH is. 
The method used by ETH is to assign a E55 Type from AAT for each of them. 

+ <mark>[ACTION]</mark> @Leo Z. is going to write down the methodology in the documentation.

### Node's name

Each node can have both a name (of the node) and a value (the value associated with that node). Normally in CRM there is no possibility to specify both.
Possible solution can be using E55 Type, or @"node's name" in the language tag of the literal value. The matter should be discussed further with more examples.

## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be held Wednesday 15/08 at 14:30
