While it can be used at least for the preferred we opted for a standard solution for both classes\n\nWhile the use of skos:prefLabel was considered, it was easily rejected because if a person has multiple appellations, skos:prefLabel would not identify the preferred one, but only the preferred string of text of that specific appellation.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage for Literals\n\n\nTo be completed\n\n\nDimension/Quantity\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDimension are measurable data which results from an observation. The outcome of an observation is always to be seen as a couple value/system where the meaning of the value is dependant on the system used.\n\n\nDimensions can be modelled in CRM as:\n\nE54 Dimension \u2192 P91 has unit \u2192  E58 Measurement Unit\n\n\nE54 Dimension \u2192 P90 has value \u2192  E60 Number\n\n\nThe modelling above is based on the differentiation between the value and the system which provide meaning to the value. \n\n\nModelling Dimension\n\n\nWhen talking about Dimension it is paramount to use an external recognisable authority to define the system which provides meaning to the value.\nIn order to define the measurement units and the quantity kind (length, weight) we rely on E55 Type and the vocabulary provided with the Ontology of units of measure (OM). \n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nhttps://collection.itatti.harvard.edu/resource/dimension/width\n \na\n \ncrm:\nE54_Dimension\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP90_has_value\n    \n6\n^^\nxsd:decimal\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP91_has_unit\n \nhttp://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/centimetre\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP2_has_type\n \nhttp://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/Width\n \n.\n\n\n\nhttps://collection.itatti.harvard.edu/resource/dimension/lenght\n \na\n \ncrm:\nE54_Dimension\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP90_has_value\n    \n12\n^^\nxsd:decimal\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP91_has_unit\n \nhttp://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/centimetre\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP2_has_type\n \nhttp://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/Length\n \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOM includes all the necessary dimensions required by our use cases. It is easy to browse, and well developed.\n\n\nOther ontologies were considered, specifically QUDT, which is \"Quantity, Unit, Dimension and Type\" schema used for modelling physical measurable properties in a machine processable form. While QUDT was the initial candidate, it was not chosen because the browsing of the units was quite difficult and, moreover, it is still under development and not yet complete or stable.   \n\n\nOM can be easily browsed here:\n\nhttp://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/\n\n\nTime-span\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCIDOC-CRM assume the existence of a SpaceTime dimension, where each temporal entity can be mapped to. This system allows the computing of diversity, closeness or equality in time between events. In doing so, it treats temporal extents in their physical sense, characterising each time interval with a beginning, an end and a duration. Additionally, CIDOC-CRM assumes that our knowledge of the time intervals of a historical event has a diverse degree of certainty, and it allows us to record such certainty/uncertainty with specific properties. A useful summarization of the treatment of time in CIDOC-CRM is available in the document \nTime\n.  \n\n\nFollowing CIDOC-CRM we will model time-related assertions as certain or uncertain, where the certain statements are going to be model using the property P81, while the uncertain statements using the property P82. The level of certainty has to be determined by the researcher carrying out the work. \n\n\nWe can have two diverse modelling scenario:\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy time statements\n\n\nPrecise time statements\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases the date is formatted following the \nISO 8601:2004\n recommendations that prescribe the composition of the date using the format:\n\n\n\n\nYYYY-MM-DD\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy Time Statements\n\n\nFuzzy time statements are modelled using CIDOC-CRM as:\n\n\n\n\nE52 Time-Span \u2192 P82a begin of the begin \u2192 xsd:dateTime\n\n\nE52 Time-Span \u2192 P82b end of the end \u2192 xsd:dateTime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe date needs to be expressed with its datatype (date or dateTime). See the \nW3C reccomandations\n for more details.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nhttps://collection.itatti.harvard.edu/resource/work/W00060289/production/timespan\n\n\na\n  \ncrm:\nE52_Time-Span\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP82a_begin_of_the_begin\n  \n1401-01-01\n^^\nxsd:date\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP82b_end_of_the_end\n      \n1700-12-31\n^^\nxsd:date\n \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodebox 5 - Time Statements\n\n\nModelling Note\n\n\n\n\n*The production event recorded here has a time interval of almost 3 centuries.

The form chosen by the consortium is to rely on a basic RDF vocabulary for representing latitude and longitude using WGS84 as a reference system. In order to do so, we will have to map the class crm:E47_Spatial_Coordinates with the corresponding class in \nW3C-Basic-Geo\n.\n\n\nWe can declare geo:Point as a subclass of crm:E47_Spatial_Coordinates with the following\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nrdfs:\nClass\n \nrdf:\nabout\n=\nhttp://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#Point\n\n\n    \nrdfs:\nsubClassOf\n \nrdf:\nresource\n=\nE47_Spatial_Coordinates\n/\n\n\n/rdfs:Class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodebox 7\n\n\nHaving mapped crm:E47_Spatial_Coordinates to geo:Point we can use two new properties\n\n\n\n\ngeo:lat\n\n\ngeo:long\n\n\n\n\nTo describe, respectively, the latitude and longitude of an E53 Place.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nhttps\n:\n//collection\n.\nitatti\n.\nharvard\n.\nedu/resource/ex/place/\n \na\n \ncrm:\nE53_Place\n \n;\n\n\ncrm:\nP87_is_identified_by\n \nhttps\n:\n//collection\n.\nitatti\n.\nharvard\n.\nedu/resource/ex/place/point\n \n.\n\n\na\n \nwgs:\nPoint\n;\n\n\nwgs:\nlat\n \n60.1701801\n \n;\n\n\nwgs:\nlong\n \n\u201c\n24.9419037\n .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodebox 8 - Latitude and Longitude of a Place",

It may nevertheless, for practical purposes, be treated as an image \u2013 this is the route chosen by the  linked.art  model, which types it as a E36 Visual Item.  There can be reasons why one wants to use a different URI for the image. For example, if the IIIF endpoint might change in the future, but the URI should remain the same. Or, if the image URI serves as the basis for other URIs (e.g. http://www.example.org/image/abcd1234/manifest) and one wants to avoid potential collision with the IIIF namespace.  The proposal here is to use a different URI for the image (for the above reasons), but to construct it so that the identifier matches the IIIF schema. The Image is the subject of the IIIF information.  e.g.  1\n2\n3\n4 http://www.example.org/image/abcd1234   a   crm: E38_Image   .  http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234   a   crm: E73_Information_Object   ;     crm: P129_is_about   http://www.example.org/image/abcd1234   ;     crm: P2_has_type   http://iiif.io/api/image    If the IIIF URI is used to directly represent the image, one can model it as:  e.g.  1\n2 http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234   a   crm: E38_Image   ;     crm: P2_has_type   http://iiif.io/api/image",

If the exact year is known, users enter the same year in all three fields. If the exact year is not known, users can enter boundaries in the earliest and latest field and specify a verbal description in the textfield (e.g. \"ca. 1950\"). This setup works in our case, where most years are specified, but might not be the best solution when dates are uncertain (see Time section for further discussion on this).\n\n\nResearchSpace offers a Date Input field. However, it requires a complete date whereas we want to allow users to just enter a year. This year then gets translated to 1 January for the earliest year and 31 December for the latest year. This step is necessary to enable searching and for the data that is stored in the dataset to be properly formated (xsd:date).\n\n\nThe insert pattern for the earliest publication date looks as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nINSERT\n \n{\n \n  \n?publication_event\n \ncrm\n:\nP4_has_time-span\n \n?time_span\n \n.\n\n  \n?time_span\n \na\n \necrm\n:\nE52_Time-Span\n \n;\n\n    \ncrm\n:\nP82a_begin_of_the_beginning\n \n?value_begin\n \n.\n\n\n}\n \nWHERE\n \n{\n\n  \nBIND\n(\nxsd\n:\ndate\n(\nCONCAT\n(\nSTR\n(\n$value\n),\n \n-01-01\n))\n \nas\n \n?value_begin\n)\n\n  \nBIND\n(\nURI\n(\nCONCAT\n(\nSTR\n(\n$subject\n),\n \n/publication/event\n))\n \nas\n \n?publication_event\n)\n\n  \nBIND\n(\nURI\n(\nCONCAT\n(\nSTR\n(\n$subject\n),\n \n/publication/date\n))\n \nas\n \n?time_span\n)\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bound \n$value\n is converted to a \nxsd:date\n and bound to \n?value_begin\n which is the value that is written into the database. The conversion to \nxsd:date\n occurs when writing to the database, which means the XSD Datatype of the field needs to be empty and a validation needs to occur via a ASK query.\n\n\nFor example, the following query validates the input as a four digit number:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nASK\n \n{\n \n  \nBIND\n(\nSTRLEN\n(\nSTR\n(\nxsd\n:\ninteger\n(\n$value\n)))\n \nas\n \n$num_value_len\n)\n\n  \nFILTER\n(\n$num_value_len\n \n=\n \n4\n)\n  \n\n}",

See the following example:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 @prefix   frbroo:   http://iflastandards.info/ns/fr/frbr/frbroo/ .  @prefix   crm:   http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/ .  http://example.org/book/publication/event   a   frbroo: F30_Publication_Event   ;       crm: P4_has_time-span   http://example.org/book/publication/date   .  http://example.org/book/publication/date   a   crm: E52_Time-Span   ;       rdfs: label   1980   ;       crm: P82a_begin_of_the_beginning   1980-01-01 ^^ xsd:date ;       crm: P82b_end_of_the_end    1980-12-31 ^^ xsd:date   .",

            "text": "We require users to specify three dates: the earliest year, the latest year and a textual date. If the exact year is known, users enter the same year in all three fields. If the exact year is not known, users can enter boundaries in the earliest and latest field and specify a verbal description in the textfield (e.g. \"ca. 1950\"). This setup works in our case, where most years are specified, but might not be the best solution when dates are uncertain (see Time section for further discussion on this).  ResearchSpace offers a Date Input field. However, it requires a complete date whereas we want to allow users to just enter a year. This year then gets translated to 1 January for the earliest year and 31 December for the latest year. This step is necessary to enable searching and for the data that is stored in the dataset to be properly formated (xsd:date).  The insert pattern for the earliest publication date looks as follows:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 INSERT   {  \n   ?publication_event   crm : P4_has_time-span   ?time_span   . \n   ?time_span   a   ecrm : E52_Time-Span   ; \n     crm : P82a_begin_of_the_beginning   ?value_begin   .  }   WHERE   { \n   BIND ( xsd : date ( CONCAT ( STR ( $value ),   -01-01 ))   as   ?value_begin ) \n   BIND ( URI ( CONCAT ( STR ( $subject ),   /publication/event ))   as   ?publication_event ) \n   BIND ( URI ( CONCAT ( STR ( $subject ),   /publication/date ))   as   ?time_span )  }    The bound  $value  is converted to a  xsd:date  and bound to  ?value_begin  which is the value that is written into the database. The conversion to  xsd:date  occurs when writing to the database, which means the XSD Datatype of the field needs to be empty and a validation needs to occur via a ASK query.  For example, the following query validates the input as a four digit number:  1\n2\n3\n4 ASK   {  \n   BIND ( STRLEN ( STR ( xsd : integer ( $value )))   as   $num_value_len ) \n   FILTER ( $num_value_len   =   4 )    }",
